# Design Patterns

## Implemented Patterns:

Circuit Breaker

Fail early and fail loud

Restricting Access

Factory

## Patterns not implemented but could consider later:

Auto Deprecation - expire crowdfund campaign after a set time

Pull over Push Payments - It protects against re-entrancy and denial of service attacks

State Machine - Steps into


## Patterns not considered:
Mortal - don't want owners to raise a crowdfund and erase all history by deleting it from the blockchain. Also don't want an Admin model for the system which will make the application more centralized.
